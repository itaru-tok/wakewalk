# WakeWalk Subscription Privacy Notice

Last updated: October 1, 2025

This Subscription Privacy Notice explains how WakeWalk ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and safeguards information specifically related to the WakeWalk monthly upgrade (auto-renewable subscription). It supplements the general WakeWalk Privacy Policy available at https://itaru-tok.github.io/wakewalk/privacy-policy.

## Information We Process

### Subscription & Purchase Data
- App Store account identifier (handled by Apple; we never see your full payment information)
- Product identifier for the WakeWalk monthly upgrade
- Transaction status (purchase, renewal, cancellation, refund)

### Usage Data
- Entitlement status (whether your subscription is currently active)
- Feature flags required to unlock premium functionality inside WakeWalk

### Diagnostics
- Anonymous error reports that help us investigate failed purchases or restore attempts

## How We Use This Information
- To verify your subscription status and unlock premium features
- To manage auto-renewal access via RevenueCat, our subscription management provider
- To help you restore purchases if you reinstall WakeWalk or switch devices
- To detect and prevent fraudulent or suspicious transactions

## Data Sharing
- We use RevenueCat to securely interface with the Apple App Store billing system. RevenueCat receives purchase identifiers from Apple and shares subscription status with WakeWalk. RevenueCat's privacy policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/
- We do not sell or share subscription information with advertisers or other third parties.

## Retention
- Subscription status is stored for as long as you maintain an active subscription and for up to 24 months after cancellation to comply with App Store reporting requirements.
- Diagnostic logs related to purchases are retained for up to 12 months and then deleted.

## Your Choices
- You can cancel the WakeWalk monthly upgrade at any time in your App Store account settings.
- You may request deletion of diagnostic data or ask questions about your subscription by contacting us at **itaruo93oo@gmail.com**. Requests will be answered within 5 days.

## Security
- RevenueCat and Apple handle payment credentials using industry-standard encryption.
- WakeWalk stores only the minimum data required to recognise active subscriptions and does not store your credit card or billing address.
