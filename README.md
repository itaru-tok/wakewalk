# WakeWalk ‚è∞

A React Native health tracking app built with Expo that helps you build consistent wake-up habits by monitoring your step count data.

## üéØ Overview

WakeWalk tracks your wake-up consistency using Apple Health step count data, displaying your progress in a beautiful contribution graph similar to GitHub's activity chart. The app categorizes each day based on your activity:

- **Perfect** üü¢: ‚â•15 steps before your target wake time
- **Good** üü°: ‚â•15 steps total for the day (but not before target time)
- **Missed** ‚ö´: <15 steps for the day

## üîß iOS Native Module Setup (Required for first-time setup)

### Custom Native Module (AlarmManager) Configuration

When setting up the project for the first time, you need to manually add native modules to the Xcode project:

1. **Run prebuild**
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild -p ios
   ```
   This copies files from `ios-modules/` to `ios/WakeWalk/`.

2. **Open project in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open ios/WakeWalk.xcworkspace
   ```

3. **Add files to Xcode project**

   Add the following files to Xcode:
   - `AlarmManager.swift`
   - `AlarmManager.m`
   - `silence-loop.wav` (optional)

   **How to add:**
   - Open `ios/WakeWalk/` folder in Finder
   - Select the files above
   - Drag and drop them to Xcode's project navigator (WakeWalk folder on the left)
   - Check "Add to targets: WakeWalk" in the dialog

4. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   pnpm ios
   ```

### Why is manual Xcode addition necessary?

The `pnpm ios` command uses `xcodebuild` internally to build the app. This tool only includes files that are registered in the `project.pbxproj` file.

```
How it works:
ios/WakeWalk/AlarmManager.swift ‚Üê File exists physically
             ‚Üì
project.pbxproj ‚Üê Must be registered here to be built
             ‚Üì
WakeWalk.app ‚Üê Only registered files are included
```

Even if files exist in the filesystem, they won't be included in the app unless registered in the Xcode project. This registration is only needed once - after that, `pnpm ios` will work on its own.

### Which AlarmManager.swift is used?

It can be confusing because there are three copies in the repo:

- `ios/AlarmManager.swift` ‚Üí this is the file Xcode actually compiles. Change this if you are hotfixing Swift code directly.
- `ios-modules/AlarmManager.swift` ‚Üí source-of-truth for the Expo config plugin. After editing it, run `pnpm prebuild:ios` (without `--clean`) to sync the change into the native project.
- `ios/WakeWalk/AlarmManager.swift` ‚Üí generated copy produced by the plugin. You normally should not edit this file; it is overwritten during prebuild.

Keep the first two files in sync if you modify the native code. A quick way is to edit `ios-modules/AlarmManager.swift` and then copy it to `ios/AlarmManager.swift` (or rerun the prebuild step) before building.

## üîê Environment Variables

### Local Development

Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is gitignored):

```bash
# RevenueCat API Key for iOS
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY=appl_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# AdMob Banner ID for iOS
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_IOS_BANNER=ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Optional: Enable premium features locally without subscription
EXPO_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_OVERRIDE=true
```

**Note**: When `EXPO_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_OVERRIDE=true`, the app will bypass RevenueCat checks and always treat the user as premium. This is useful for local development and testing premium features.

### EAS Build (TestFlight & Production)

For EAS builds, environment variables must be configured using **EAS Secrets** (not committed to git):

```bash
# Configure environment variables for all environments
eas env:create

# Follow the interactive prompts:
# 1. Variable name: EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY
# 2. Variable value: appl_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# 3. Select visibility: Sensitive
# 4. Select environments: development, preview, production

# Repeat for AdMob:
eas env:create
# 1. Variable name: EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_IOS_BANNER
# 2. Variable value: ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# 3. Select visibility: Sensitive
# 4. Select environments: development, preview, production
```

**Verify your configuration:**
```bash
eas env:list --environment preview
eas env:list --environment production
```

### Build Profiles

The app has 4 build profiles defined in `eas.json`:

| Profile | Premium Override | Purpose |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **development** | No | Development builds with dev client |
| **personal** | ‚úÖ Yes | Personal testing builds (always premium, no ads) |
| **preview** | No | TestFlight distribution (real subscription flow) |
| **production** | No | App Store release (real subscription flow) |

**Important**: `.env` files are not uploaded to EAS build servers. Always use `eas env:create` for remote builds.

## üîÑ OTA Updates

Deploy JavaScript changes instantly without App Store review:

```bash
pnpm eas:update:preview "Fix message"      # TestFlight
pnpm eas:update:production "Fix message"   # Production
```

**OTA-compatible**: JS code, assets, UI changes  
**Requires new build**: Native code, permissions, environment variables

## üé® Design System

The app uses a consistent design system with:

- **Colors**: Dark theme with accent colors defined in `src/constants/theme.ts`
- **Typography**: Comfortaa and Inter font families
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale (xs: 4px, sm: 8px, md: 16px, lg: 24px, xl: 32px)
- **Components**: Reusable components with glass morphism effects

## üìä Current Status

**Development Phase**: The app is currently in active development with mock data implementation.

### Implemented Features ‚úÖ
- Tab navigation with Alarm and Stats screens
- Time picker interface
- Settings toggles (sound, vibration, snooze)
- Contribution graph with responsive layout
- Glass morphism UI effects
- Mock data generation for development

### Planned Features üîÑ
- Apple HealthKit integration
- Real step count data processing
- Push notifications for wake-up reminders
- Weekly/monthly statistics
- Export functionality

## üß™ Development Notes

- **Mock Data**: The stats screen currently uses generated mock data for development and testing
- **Health Integration**: HealthKit integration code is prepared but commented out during development
- **Error Handling**: Simplified for development; will be enhanced for production
- **Testing**: Test framework setup is planned (Jest + React Native Testing Library)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Setup
The app uses Expo's configuration system. Key configuration files:
- `app.json`: Expo app configuration
- `biome.json`: Code quality and formatting rules
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

### AsyncStorage Keys
- `TARGET_WAKE_TIME`: User's target wake time (HH:MM format)
- `LAST_PROCESSED_DATE`: Last processed date to avoid recomputation

## üì± Screenshots

*Screenshots will be added as the app development progresses*

## ü§ù Contributing

1. **Code Style**: Follow the established patterns and use Biome for formatting
2. **Commits**: Use conventional commit messages
3. **Testing**: Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before submitting
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when adding features

See `docs/AGENTS.md` for detailed development guidelines.

## Bug
„ÉªKilling app resets all settings...
„ÉªAfter missing alarm, and open the app it has still scheduled time and won't show wake walk session.
